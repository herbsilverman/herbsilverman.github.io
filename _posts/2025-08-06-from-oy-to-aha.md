True confession: I make, well, about [1,000,001 mistakes](https://herbsilverman.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/how-integrity-initiates-with-1000001-mistakes/) every single day — whether in communication, pronunciation, or just plain vagueness.

## **Broadcast My Stories**

Even more frustrating is my inability to broadcast my stories at crucial times—it drives me insane.

*Oy!*

Instead of getting glum or irritated, I bottle up that energy and use it the next day to make my expression stronger, more precise, and clearer. I do this not in pursuit of perfection, but of clarity.

As always, in any situation, trying your hardest—even for a lifetime—is deeply fulfilling when you finally succeed. And when that clarity finally arrives—*Aha!*—it feels like magic.

*How might you turn today’s misunderstandings into tomorrow’s breakthroughs?*
